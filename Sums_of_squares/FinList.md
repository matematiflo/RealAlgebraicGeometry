# TO DO

Write a function `nList` that takes `n : Nat` and returns the list `[0, ... , n - 1 ]`. Write a TR version.

Make each `nList n` a type, whose terms are the members of that list. This should be similar to what is done in `Mathlib` for `Zmod n`.

Use this to compute sums? Enumerate finite types?
