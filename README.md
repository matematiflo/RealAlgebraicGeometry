# Real Algebraic Geometry

The goal of this project is to formalise basic results of real algebraic geometry in [Lean4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4), using resources from the [Mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) library and apporting to it in return.

1. Real algebra
    - [Sums of squares](Sums_of_squares/Sums_of_squares.md)
    - Formally real fields
    - Artin-Schreier theory
    - Real-closed fields
    - The real closure of an ordered field
1. The real Nullstellensatz
    - Real ideals
    - Sturm's theorem
    - The real-radical of an ideal
    - Affine sets over real-closed fields
